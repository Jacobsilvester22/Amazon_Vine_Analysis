# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
## Overview 
In this project we have access to 50 datasets. Each one contains reviews of a specific product, from clothing apparel to wireless products. Picking one of these datasets, we will use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Next, we will use PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset.
